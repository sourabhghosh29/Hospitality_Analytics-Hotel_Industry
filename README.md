Analytics to provide actionable insight to companies Revenue Management
Revenue management (RM) is the application of data and analytics to optimize product price and availability for maximum revenue. In other words, a revenue management specialist is looking for ways to sell the right product (i.e. a room) via the right distribution channel, for a reasonable price to a customer who is ready to buy.
